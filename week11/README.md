## AA Meetings 
In this sketch, I used a black background with a bright pink font. They are easy to read and the colors go well together. (I will admit I chose colors I liked more than colors that the audience would like because we are not graded for design but functionality)
For functionality, I thought that indivuals will want to filter by day and time for meetings and have them show up on the map. I decided to have the bottom half of the side bar for when you click on the location and need more information about what meetings are there. This is so not to crowd the map.

## Dear Diary
My diary will incude all kinds of experiences I am having in my three main data visualization courses. I included a fourth section that will have work that I am inspired by and wanted to share with people.
I thought of having a cute side photo in each section about the general feel I have for the class. I want this blog to have a causal diary tone to it. I would like to develop it more in the future for myself since I've thought about blogging so a long time now and this is the perfect opportunity for it.

## Temperature Sensor
For my temperature sensor, I originally thought of doing the days of the week and you can compare the temperature in one week on the clock (click day/night for am and pm); but since we are measuring temperature during a seasonal change, I decided to indclude a line (maybe bar) graph to show the whole month trend in temperature variation as well. 
I might end up just with the line graph if time is limited because I do think month data will be conveying more information.
