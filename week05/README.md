# Assignment 5 NoSQL
## Goal: 
To use NoSQL to create a database of diary entries. 
I choose NoSQL to be my building block for my Dear_Diary database because I want the flexibility to change the data I input. I also only need to have a filter like date and topic to get my data out, data that is in the form of a diary entry. I am not interested in having a rigoursly broken down structure and avoid redundancy (I do not really HAVE redundancy since each entry will be different and unique). For this case, NoSQL just seems like the option to go. 

The way I will oragnize my data:
